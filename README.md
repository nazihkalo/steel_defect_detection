# Detecting Defects in Steel Manufacturing Line using Computer Vision

## This is my attempt at the Severstal Kaggle competition for deteSeverstal

Here is a description of the competition/objective:
-----
==> **In this competition, youâ€™ll help engineers improve the algorithm by localizing and classifying surface defects on a steel sheet.**

I will be using images from high frequency cameras to power a defect detection algorithm.


## Here are samples of the different kinds of defects (each combination from the training set is represented here)
